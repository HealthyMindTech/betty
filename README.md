## What to bet on

  * Challenge example: "The USD-HUF exchange rate will increase between 2021.05.01. 17:00 and 2021.05.01. 18:00" - the rate observation at the second timestamp will be greater than it is at the first timestamp.
* Active users/players on different platforms
  * Challenge example: "The number of active players at chess.com will decrease between 2021.05.01. 17:00 and 2021.05.01. 17:05" - the active player count at the second timestamp will be less than it is at the first timestamp. - https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api
